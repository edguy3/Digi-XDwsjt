# Digi-XDwsjt
Win32 dll for FT8 modulating/demodulating. 
The name is motivated by the name, Xmmt.ocx, that was used to interface to the MMTTY RTTY modulator and demodulator.

This project builds a Win32 dll, XDwsjtFT8.dll. It uses the sources from wsjtx-2.0.1 per the WSJT-X license requirements.

Further information about the dll is in the Makefile <a href="Makefile">here</a>.

The sources from wsjtx-2.0.1 are reproduced here in wsjtx-2.0.1-subset.7z. Only the sources needed to build XDwsjtFT8.dll are included.
